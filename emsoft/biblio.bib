	Abstract = {Range analysis is an important task in obtaining the correct, yet fast and inexpensive arithmetic circuits. The traditional methods, either simulation-based or static, have the disadvantage of low efficiency and coarse bounds, which may lead to unnecessary bits. In this paper, we propose a new method that combines several techniques to perform fixed-point range analysis in a datapath towards obtaining the much tighter ranges efficiently. We show that the range and the bit-width allocation can be obtained with better results relative to the past methods, and in significantly shorter time.},

Our approach adopts different levels of analysis giving the designer the opportunity to terminate it at any stage to obtain a result. Range analysis is achieved using a combined affine and interval arithmetic approach to reduce the number of bits. Precision analysis involves a coarse-grain and fine-grain analysis. The best representation, in fixed-point or floating-point, for the numbers is then chosen based on the range, precision and latency. Three case studies are used: discrete cosine transform, B-Splines and RGB to YCbCr color conversion. Our analysis can run over 200 times faster than current approaches to this problem while producing more accurate results, on average within 2-3% of an exhaustive search.},

@article{Mallik2007,
	Abstract = {The modern era of embedded system design is geared toward the design of low-power systems. One way to reduce power in an application-specified integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation is to reduce the bit-width precision of its computation units. This paper describes algorithms to optimize the bit widths of fixed-point variables for low power in a SystemC-based ASIC design environment. We propose an optimal bit-width allocation algorithm for two variables and a greedy heuristic that works for any number of variables. The algorithms are used in the automation of converting floating-point SystemC programs into ASIC synthesizable SystemC programs. Expected inputs are profiled to estimate errors in the finite precision conversions. Experimental results for the tradeoffs between quantization error, power consumption, and hardware resources used are reported on a set of four SystemC benchmarks that are mapped onto a 0.18-mum ASIC cell library from Artisan Components. We demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the power consumption by 50% on the average by allowing roundoff errors to increase from 0.5% to 1%},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a method that offers a uniform treatment for bit-width optimisation of both fixed-point and floating-point designs. Our work utilises automatic differentiation to compute the sensitivities of outputs to the bit-width of the various operands in the design. This sensitivity analysis enables us to explore and compare fixed-point and floating-point implementation for a particular design. As a result, we can automate the selection of the optimal number representation for each variable in a design to optimize area and performance. We implement our method in the BitSize tool targeting reconfigurable architectures, which takes user-defined constraints to direct the optimisation procedure. We illustrate our approach using applications such as ray-tracing and function approximation.},

@article{memoryMPC,
	Abstract = {Explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an effective alternative to reduce the on-line computational demand of traditional MPC. The idea of explicit MPC is to pre-compute the optimal MPC feedback law off-line and store it in a form of look-up table which is to be used in on-line phase. One of the main bottlenecks in an implementation of explicit MPC is memory required to store optimal solutions. This limit its applicability to systems with few states, small number of constraints, and short prediction horizons. In this paper, we present a novel way of reducing the memory footprint of explicit MPC solutions. The procedure is based on encoding all data (i.e., the critical regions and the feedback laws) as universal numbers (unums), which can be viewed as a memory-efficient extension of IEEE floating point standard. By doing so, we illustrate that the total memory footprint can be reduced by 80% without losing control accuracy. An additional advantage of proposed approach is, it can be applied on top of existing complexity reduction techniques.},

@article{imperialrmpc,
	Abstract = {MPC is becoming increasingly implemented on embedded systems, where low precision computation is preferred either to reduce costs, speedup execution or reduce power consumption. However, in a low precision implementation, constraint satisfaction cannot be guaranteed. To enforce constraint satisfaction under numerical errors, we adopt tools from forward error analysis to compute an error bound on the output of the embedded controller. We treat this error as a state disturbance and use it to inform the design of a constraint-tightening robust controller. The technique is validated via a practical implementation on an FPGA evaluation board.},
