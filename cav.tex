We set the confidence interval to 99\% for PAF and PrAn, and mark the smallest reported roundoff errors for each benchmark in bold. Asterisk (*) highlights a difference of more than one order of magnitude between PAF and FPTaylor.} 															{17}

\uudummytable {Comparison between PAF, given uniform (uni), normal (norm) and exponential (exp) input distributions, and FPTaylor. The PAF columns report 99\% of the support of the output range distribution. The FPTaylor columns report the worst-case output ranges.
