Arithmetic in computers unavoidably introduces roundoff errors stemming from the use of finite-precision formats to represent real numbers.
%
It is essential, for example in safety-critical applications, not only to be aware of the existence of these errors, but also to bound them using rigorous analysis techniques.
%
%which comes with several challenges. 
%
% The aim of this thesis is the rigorous analysis of roundoff errors in floating-point programs.
% With which comes several challenges.

%
The magnitude of roundoff errors depends on the range of the input variables involved in the computations.
%
Moreover, it is not trivial to study how errors propagate through computations, in particular, when dealing with non-linearities or transcendental functions.
%
Furthermore, extending roundoff error analysis to computer programs, rather than straight-line expressions, comes with the burden of dealing with common programming constructs, like conditionals, where roundoff errors can alter the ideal execution of a program. 
%
Hence, an if-statement conditional might evaluate to true in reals, but because of roundoff errors, the same conditional may evaluate to false in the computer. 
%
%In other words, all the computations obey the worst-case error bound.
%
%Worst-case error bounds are priceless in those applications, like safety-critical systems, where we need such strong guarantees.
%
%In other words, no one would feel comfortable traveling on autonomous running aircrafts which are safe "on average".
%
%At the same time, worst-case analysis could be very conservative, and it might overestimate the average (or typical) error by many orders of magnitude. 
%

The contributions of this thesis are in the subject matter of the rigorous analysis of roundoff errors in floating-point programs.
%, numbered in the following.
%
%In this thesis, we study how to bound roundoff errors in computer programs.
First, we show how to combine automated theorem provers and error analysis techniques, to reason about the mix of floating-point and real arithmetics.
%
Then, we implemented these ideas and use the resulting prototype to detect control-flow instabilities in computer programs.
%
%1  What we do?
Second, we show how to embed rigorous worst-case error analysis techniques in the design of micro-controllers.
%
%2  Why?
This allows us to sensibly reduce the memory foot-print of the controller, and address the roundoff error stemming from the low-cost floating-point precision format as a disturbance affecting the system, without impacting the stability of the same.
%
%1-Limitations
%2-What we did
%3-Benefits
%
Finally, we show the limitations of worst-case error analysis when dealing with probabilistic computations. 
%
Hence, we introduce our rigorous probability-framework to compute average roundoff errors.
%
From an implementation perspective, we can provide to the user much more useful error bounds compared to the state-of-the-art worst-case errors.
